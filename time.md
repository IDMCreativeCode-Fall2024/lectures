## History of Measuring Time

Measuring and visualizing time is a long-running human project that brings together histories of technological experimentation, politics, religion, and environmental measurement and observation. Early attempts to measure time were often based on environmental observations such as tracking the position of the sun, or measuring the movement of sand or water through a device or through observing other organisms.

The first timekeeper is likely the gnomon, a vertical rod that casts its shadow on the ground.

A similar strategy is used in sundials that have also been found to exist since BC 1500 in ancient Rome and Greece.

Hourglasses were used in churches to time the length of the sermon; long sermons were especially popular in the 17th century and could easily stretch to three hours or more.

In the 1800s, Carl Linnaeus, who invented our system of taxonomy, made flower clocks and calendars popular. He claimed that the time could accurately be told by observing several types of flowers and how they open, close, and track the sun. Gardeners would make elaborate plantings of these different types of flowers to show the passage of the year.

For a more contemporary attempt at telling the time by observing other organisms, [the Phenology Clock](http://tegabrain.com/The-Phenology-Clock) maps the timing of events in different species' lives across a year.

## Time and Technology

The introduction of railways across Europe and the USA in the 1800s created a need for time synchronicity across distances.

Today, computer networks continue to drive the development of technologies to synchronize time more precisely.

**[Dot Clock](http://www.vendian.org/envelope/dir2/day_of_dots_clock/?do=01:51:25), by Vendian**

This example uses one dot to represent every second in the day:

Another clock, **[All the Minutes](http://alltheminutes.com/)**, is comprised of tweets about the current time.

Sam Lavigne is known for his political art.

## Time and Art

Here’s **[Sweeper Clock](http://dezeen.com/2009/06/07/sweeper-clock-by-maarten-baas/)** by Maarten Bas, a movie featuring two men with brooms pushing lines of debris to form moving clock hands.

**Felix Gonzalez-Torres: ["Untitled" (Perfect Lovers) 1991](https://www.moma.org/collection/works/81074)**

Initially set to the same time, these identical battery-powered clocks will eventually fall out of sync, or may stop entirely. Conceived shortly after Gonzalez-Torres’s partner was diagnosed with AIDS, this work uses everyday objects to track and measure the inevitable flow of time. When one of the clocks stops or breaks, they can both be reset, thereby resuming perfect synchrony.

A well-known ‘crowdsourced’ clock is Christian Marclay’s **[The Clock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Clock_%282010_film%29)**, a 24-hour film made up of six or seven thousand clips, each of which either says or displays the (actual) time of day or makes a cogent reference to time.
